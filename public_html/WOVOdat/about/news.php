			<h3>Job advertisement for WOVOdat research fellow</h3>
			
			<p>Young and research-intensive, Nanyang Technological University (NTU
			Singapore) is ranked 13th globally. It is also placed 1st among the
			world¹s best young universities. The Earth Observatory of Singapore (EOS)
			at NTU is a national science Research Centre of Excellence. Its mission is
			to conduct fundamental research on earthquakes, volcanic eruptions,
			tsunami and climate change in and around Southeast Asia, toward safer and
			more sustainable societies.</p>
			 
			 <p>WOVOdat project aims at building a comprehensive global database on
			volcanic unrest tot understanding pre-eruptive processes and improving
			eruption forecasts (www.wovodat.org). We invite
			applications for a Research Fellow as part of the WOVOdat team to develop
			application tools by which WOVOdat can be used for probabilistic eruption
			forecasting, such as pattern recognition and event tree analysis.</p>

			<h3>WOVOdat workshop “How to Optimize the Use of Volcano Monitoring Database”</h3>

			<p>WOVOdat organized a one week workshop on  “How to Optimize the Use of Volcano Monitoring Database” at Earth Observatory of Singapore – NTU.</p>

			<p><b>Participants:</b> Centre for Volcanological and Geological Hazard Mitigation (CVGHM, Indonesia), Philippine Institute for Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS, Philippine), Rabaul Volcano Observatory (RVO, Papua New Guinea), and EOS volcano group. </p>

			<h4>Topics:</h4> 
			<ul type="circle">
				<li>Brainstorming and discussion on how WOVOdat system will be used and useful during volcano crisis, for eruption forecasting. </li>
				<li>Exchange experiences between volcano observatory on using WOVOdat as their monitoring database. PHIVOLCS has been developing data processing automation (SEISAN to WOVOdat, SWARM to WOVOdat, VALVE to WOVOdat), and various operational tools developed in PHIVOLCS and CVGHM localhost.</li>
				<li>New tools developed by WOVOdat team: installation and operational.</li>
				<li>Future development and plan of WOVOdat.</li>
