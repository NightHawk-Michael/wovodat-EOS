				<h2><br><b>THE FIRST IDEA</b></h2>
				<h3>The Idea of Volcano Epidemiology</h3>
					<p class="home1">
						After the eruption of Mount St. Helens (USA) in 1980, researchers in various research groups around the world were trying to find ways to better understand volcanic unrest.   C. Newhall (USGS) and H. Okada (Hokkaido University) began planning how to organize and use information on volcanic unrest in a database.   They also started discussions with the Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program (GVP), to interface with information in the GVP database of historical eruptions.<br>
						<br>
						By analogy to medicine, WOVOdat contains data on "symptoms" and the GVP catalogues outcomes.  Together, WOVOdat and the GVP database are concerned with global occurrences and associations of unrest and eruptions.  Practicing doctors and volcanologists can use epidemiological databases to aid their diagnoses..<br>
						<br>
						Before the era of computers and databases, all of this was done by a few scholars and years of research in libraries.   But it is impractical for any individual to do all of the needed library study, and such study also takes much longer than is available during crises.<br>
						<br>
						The internet now makes interactive access with the database possible for all.<br>

					<h2>MISSION</h2>
					<p  class="home2" ><span style="font-size:14px; ">			
						<b>Online tool for crisis response <br>
						and for study of volcanic unrest</b></span>
					</p>
					<p class="home1">
						During periods of volcanic unrest, forecasting of further activity is aided by knowledge of previous activity at the restless volcano and knowledge of unrest and eruptions at similar 	volcanoes.  WOVOdat expands access to that information. 
						<br><br>
						Advances in instrumentation, networking, and data storage technologies have greatly increased observer's ability to collect volcanic data and share observations with colleagues.   The wealth of data creates numerous opportunities for gaining a better understanding of magmatic conditions and processes, if the data can be easily accessed for comparison.   To allow comparison of volcanic unrest, a central database called WOVOdat is created.  WOVOdat will contain time-stamped and georeferenced data from WOVO observatories and other contributors in common and accessible formats<br>

					<b>WOVOdat will serve as a reference for those handling volcanic crises, and as a tool for those studying the activity of volcanoes in between and leading to eruptions.   Initially, it will provide tools for simple graphical comparisons such as the RSAM plots on our homepage.    Later, we will add tools for Boolean searches and searches based on pattern recognition.</b>
